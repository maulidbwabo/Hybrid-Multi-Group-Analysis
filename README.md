# Hybrid-Multi-Group-Analysis
# This project has started by constructing the interactions terms
# Second, Project has designed the dimension reduction model (PLS-PM) with the interaction terms
# Third phase, the multi-group analysis using two categorical variableS while including the interaction terms
#Fourth phase, project compare the above multi-group analysis with the PLS tree (Pathmox), this is similar to CART modeling in Regression analysis
