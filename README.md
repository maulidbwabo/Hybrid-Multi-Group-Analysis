# Hybrid-Multi-Group-Analysis
# This project has started by the constructing the interactions terms
# Second, Project has design the dimension reduction model with the interaction terms
# Third phase, the multi-group analysis using two categorical variable while including the interaction terms
#Fourth phase, project compare the above multi-group analysis with the PLS tree (Pathmox), this is similar to CART modeling in Regression analysis
